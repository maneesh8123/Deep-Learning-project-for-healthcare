# Deep-Learning-project-for-healthcare
Created a predictive model to estimate if a patient is eligible for the first 
prescription of the “Target Drug” in the next 30 days.

Some of the patients present in the test file are eligible for the drug prescription 
within a month and some of them are not, using each patient’s historical data 
predict if he/she is eligible for the “Target Drug”.

For this project ,created a binary model to like labels = 1 and 0,1 represents for 
patients are eligible for the prescription ,0 represents not eligible.
