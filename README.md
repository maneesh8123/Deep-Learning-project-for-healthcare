# Prescription Eligibility Predictor
Developed a predictive model to estimate whether a patient is eligible for their first prescription of the "Target Drug" within the next 30 days.

The test file includes patients who may or may not be eligible for the prescription based on their historical data. The model predicts eligibility for each patient.

For this project, I developed a binary classification model, where a label of 1 indicates eligibility for the prescription and a label of 0 indicates ineligibility.
